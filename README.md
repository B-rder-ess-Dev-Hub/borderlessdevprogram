# ABOUT B<>RDER/ESS

Borderless is the tech Not-for-Profit arm of Crypto Smart aimed at raising at least 100 African tech developers annually that can build Web3 products that benefit Africa.

Here are our activities for the past 2 years.

## MILESTONES REACHED

* Physical hub:
We started our remote developers' program in June 2022, and by October 2022 we were able to open our physical developers' hub to begin physical classes.

* B<>rder/ess 1.0 Tech Event:
We held our maiden tech event on Nov 4th 2022 in the City of Port-Harcourt, Nigeria. We had over 1,000 young people attend physically and virtually and 10% of them signed up to learn web3 dev skills and become developers.

## STRATEGY

* Trainings:
We achieve our aim, by setting up physical tech
hubs for training and mentoring young people to last in the web3 space.

* Building and Mentorship:
During the program, young people will be matched with live web3 teams to intern at and build products.

* Events:
We hold quarterly dev events to certify and showcase newly trained developers and attract new intending developers.

* Projects:
Students get the opportunity to build something that will benefit the web3 space.

## Why B<>rder/ess?
If we are ever going to make our societies
better with the help of technology, then we
must invest in our people to build with it, so
we can build solutions that solve our
problems and solutions the world can use
for economic benefit.

## NEXT COURSE OF ACTION
We're set to build our B<>rder/ess mobile and web app, to bring education to web2 devs wanting to transition to web3 or learn how to develop web3 products.
