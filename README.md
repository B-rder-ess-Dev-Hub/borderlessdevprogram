## MILESTONES REACHED

1. Building physical Web3 hubs on campuses https://borderlessbuild.dev/clubs-and-hubs#:~:text=%E2%80%A2-,Our%20Hubs,-Borderless%20Hub%20PortHarcourt
These hubs provide resources, infrastructure, and mentorship for students to work on real-world blockchain projects, creative expressions, and contributions.

Established the first hub in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, accessible to the University of Port-Harcourt and Rivers State University Students (2022)
Established the 2nd one, which is the B<>rder/ess Web3 Product House at UNN, accessible to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka Universities (2024)

2. Organising quarterly chain-focused Cipher Sessions
We've hosted eight quarterly deep-dive bootcamps and developer builder sessions, exploring specific ecosystems such as Arbitrum, Celo, Lisk, Metis, Algorand, Base, Filecoin, and other EVMs. During these sessions, we trained developers to deploy smart contracts, launch products, explore tooling, and integrate chain-specific SDKs in our Hackathons and Demo sessions. Here's one impact we created for Op Stack in Lisk.

Ran broader developer-focused workshops on Solidity, Dev Tools, and Embedded Systems.
Helped transition 300+ developers from Web2 to Web3 with practical, project-based learning.
3. Organising quarterly general developer Cipher Sessions
We've organised 12 general Tech Cipher sessions so far, where students from different universities take part and learn Product Design, Web Design and Development, Data Analysis, Cyber Security and more.


4. Hosting Web3 events and Funding Programs
Organised 3 B<>rder/ess Web3 Events that impacted 4,000 attendees cumulatively with web3 education.
Organised campus-wide Web3 hackathons, bootcamps, and panels to showcase student innovation.
Created entry points for creators and non-technical participants into Web3 awareness and adoption, and pioneered the Web3 for Universities initiative in GG23, raised $33,000, and funded 50 Projects and initiatives for web3 Education in Universities.


5. Providing crypto education & financial literacy training
Delivered crypto savings and finance training tailored to student communities.
Bridged the gap between Web3 tools and real-world financial empowerment.


6. Establishing Web3 Campus Tech Clubs
Grew to 14+ active tech clubs across Nigerian universities.
Each club drives local developer onboarding, peer-to-peer learning, and project incubation.


7. Launching DevTools & on-chain products
Incubated byteonchain.xyz, the simplest Web3 onboarding and education tool using attestations.

Launched open-source developer tools like bytestore https://github.com/B-rder-ess-Dev-Hub/ByteStore-SDK and incubation programs, empowering students to contribute to public goods.

B<>rder/ess Developers and contributors built Bitsave Protocol an Onchain Savings protocol that has won multiple Incubation Programs and Grants from 3 ecosystems and serves thousands of users.

Is B<>rder/ess Open Source?
YES
B<>rder/ess is built on open-source values everything we create is non-rivalrous and non-excludable, meaning our resources, tools, and knowledge can be freely accessed, used, and improved by anyone without diminishing their value for others. We see developer growth as a public good: the more people who learn, contribute, and build, the stronger the web3 ecosystem becomes.

Our repositories, tools like byteonchain.xyz for onboarding and educational materials are released under permissive open-source licenses (e.g., MIT/GPL), giving builders the freedom to use, study, modify, and share our work.

## STRATEGY

* Trainings:
We achieve our aim, by setting up physical tech
hubs for training and mentoring young people to last in the web3 space.

* Building and Mentorship:
During the program, young people will be matched with live web3 teams to intern at and build products.

* Events:
We hold quarterly dev events to certify and showcase newly trained developers and attract new intending developers.

* Projects:
Students get the opportunity to build something that will benefit the web3 space.

## Why B<>rder/ess?
If we are ever going to make our societies
better with the help of technology, then we
must invest in our people to build with it, so
we can build solutions that solve our
problems and solutions the world can use
for economic benefit.

## NEXT COURSE OF ACTION
We're set to build our B<>rder/ess mobile and web app, to bring education to web2 devs wanting to transition to web3 or learn how to develop web3 products.
